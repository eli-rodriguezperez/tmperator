Tmperator is a home weather station based on a Raspberry Pi and a SenseHat. This is the front-end app that's supposed to be fed by services that read the different measured values and then display them on a WebComponent based app. This repo should follow the [open-wc](https://github.com/open-wc/open-wc) recommendation.
